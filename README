This is the firmware for the Tequila Sunrise Bot.

This contraption makes tequila sunrise drinks. To make a drink:

1.  Place a cup under the spout. Make sure the black hoses are aimed into the cup!
2.  Press the normal button to make a regular strength tequila sunrise drink or 
    press the strong button to make a stronger tequila sunride drink.
3.  Wait for your drink to be made. Once all three motors stop, your drink is ready! 
    Bottoms up!

What if you don’t like tequila sunrise drinks? Please hack this bot to have it make 
another drink! Scan the QR code to go to GitHub where you can download the source code 
for the bot. We have avrlibc code and a Arduino sketch for you to work with. Pick your 
poison!

The code is not very long and well documented. Give it a quick look see, then hack 
new proportions for your new drink. There is a programmer attached to the bot so you 
can program the Ardunio Uno yourself.

If you hack the bot, you’re responsible for buying new booze and setting it up. We 
recommend running water through the hoses and rinsing off the hoses before you setup 
you own drinks. 

Have fun!
Sincerely,

    The Party Robotics Team!
